    <p> Our first scratch game was about Dog Dog, a ordinary dog that has to travel through dimensions and kill
    the villains of each dimension with laser eyes to save his master.  Using Scratch, we created a game that allows the 
    user to travel through the dimensions fighting zombies, mukakus and more.  </p>

    <p> Our final project of the year was a space adventures game.  You are an astronaut going in space to Mars, when suddenly your ship is struck by
    unknown energy and errors pop up by the dozen that you must fix.  To beat the game you must figure out who caused the errors, fix the errors and escape
    from the clutches of evil aliens.  </p>
